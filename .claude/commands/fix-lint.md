# Fix Lint

Fix all linting errors in the codebase by:
1. Running `pnpm lint` to identify all linting errors
2. Analyzing the errors and their locations
3. Fixing each error by editing the affected files
4. Running `pnpm lint` again to verify all errors are resolved
5. If any errors remain, repeat steps 2-4 until all errors are fixed
